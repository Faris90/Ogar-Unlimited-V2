### Note:
Please note that this is updated very frequently and you should check for updates every week. I added an update system but It needs to be initialized by you (because I don't think it is the right thing to do, updating without your consent). Also you may copy this and modify it just please give some credit to the hard working dev team, that is all I care. Another note is that I am sometimes terrible in my grammar (I still cannot spell potato out loud). If there is an issue, please notify me. If there is something you want in this, just make a pull request.

### DO NOT BUY OGAR UL!
If you've purchased a copy of Ogar UL, you just got scammed. It is open source which means it is FREE. yes FREE! So if you paid any money, well, too bad.

### DO not get from other sources
If you got ogarUL from anywhere besides github, DELETE IT IMMEDIATLY!!! Those might be bundled with viruses and other things. Remember you are running this probably from `sudo`. Get the github one here: https://github.com/AJS-development/Ogar-unlimited


### How do I install plugins from the official library?
the official library is here: https://github.com/AJS-development/OgarUL-Plugin-Library


To install any plugins from the library, first do `plugin available` and remember the name of the plugin you want. then do `plugin install [name]` and you are set!

### How do I use other plugins?

To use a plugin, simply download the folder and drag it into the plugins folder in src or use the plugin add command. To use the plugin add command, the plugin must have a files.txt file. then click on that file, click raw, and then copy the url. Then do `plugin add [url] [pluginname]` and it will even reload automatically for you. Thats it! example, doing `plugin add https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AJS-development/OgarUL-Plugin-Library/master/devtools-plugin/files.txt devtools` will add a plugin called devtools to your plugins.

### How do I create a plugin? Is there Documentation?

This is the fun part, creating your own plugins. There is an example plugin you should look at and there is a template plugin. To get started, you can look at the plugin API documentation [here](https://github.com/AJS-development/Ogar-unlimited/wiki/Plugin-API-Tutorial).

### Multiverse
Multiverse is for having multiple servers in one console. This is how you use it. The command for multiverse is `multiverse [command] [arg]`. Available commands are `list`,`create`,`remove`, and `select`. The list is used by doing `multiverse list` and it will list servers and their ports. It will also tell you f that is the master or is selected. The create command creates a server. The args are `multiverse create [name] [port] [gamemode] [title]`. Make sure that the port is not repeated in other servers. The title arg is optional and spaces are allowed, it is what is displayed in the client. Note that only the master has a statsport and sends multiverse data. To remove a server, do `multiverse remove [name]`. To then control the server using console commands, you have to select it. Do `multiverse select [name]` to select a server and start controlling it.


### Easy Verify
For those of you who have trouble with minions and such, this feature is for you. Currently, there is no program that can get through all of ogar unlimited's filters and features, but in some future, someone might be able to crack the other anti bot measures. So we created an easy verify system, a currently foolproof system that filters out bots. To turn on, turn verify to 1 in config. Then when a player spawns, he is frozen at a spot and is given a 3 digit code. Then that player presses w to kill himself and types in the code in the nickname box. Afterword, when pressing play again, it shows a success message. Press w again to play.

### Minions
You use minions by doing `minion [yourid] [amount] [minionname]`. Then, they will start following your mouse. You can control those minions by useing E and R keys. E for split. R for feed. If that doesnt work because of you client, turn useER to 0 in config.ini. then in game, q key. If you press it, a B will appear next to your name. then controls will be normal except now ejecting and splitting will happen on your minions not you. you can re-enter normal control mode by pressing q again. You can disable minions by doing `minion [id]` in console for just you or do `minion destroy` and it will remove all minions.

### OP(2.4.5) - Guide,
You use OP by first setting who has op by doing op [id] in console. Then, that player can use the op features in game by pressing q. Then a c will appear next to your name. If you press w in this state, it gives you 100 more mass. If you press space in this state, you will be able to rejoin instantly. You will find out that if you press q again, two c's will appear next to your name. if you press w in this state, you shoot viruses. If you press space in this state, you shoot tiny things (almost invisible) that if someone eats, their mass is reduced by 100. Then, if you press q again,3 c's will appear.press w with 3c's, you shoot a virus, but whoever who eats it will be trolled :). If you press space with 3 c's the person who eats the virus will explode.If you  press q again, 4 cs will appear and if you press w, you will shoot a virus tha kills people and space, it shoots a kick virus. You can then exit op by pressing q again after doing an action or by pressing Q until the three c's will dissappear (so that you can normally split and shoot mass).

* Note: names (CC's) dont work when player name is blank and it doesnt work on Virus and Leap gamemodes

## Custom skins (guide)
You can use custom skins by putting them in customskins.txt
the format is `[shortcut] [skin]` for the skin field, to use a URL skin, you do `:http://url` DO NOT FORGET TO GET REID OF THE S IF IT IS HTTPS OR FORGET TO PUT A : BEFORE.To use an agario skin, use `%skinname`To use that skin in game simply do `<skinsshortuct>` and then your name,


## Obtaining and Using

As Ogar Unlimited is written in Node.js, you must have Node.js and its "ws", and "request" module installed to use it (unless you are using the Windows binary). You can usually download Node using your distribution's package manager (for *nix-like systems), or from [the Node website](http://nodejs.org). To install the "ws" and "request" module that is required, open up your system command line (cmd for windows, terminal for mac) and type "npm install ws" and do "npm install request". To see a detailed guide go to the [Installation guide] (https://github.com/AJS-development/Ogar-unlimited/wiki/Installation) in the wiki

(You can install and use Ogar unlimited on windows very quickly. First click `Installdependancies.bat` in src. Then wait (it takes a while), then click `Start.bat` and you're off! The next time you start the server, you only have to click `Start.bat`)

~~ (Binarys are also available in Releases)~~ OUTDATED

Currently, Ogar listens on the following addresses and ports:
* *:88 - for the stats server (I would use it to track servers)
* *:443 - for the game server

Please note that on some systems, you may have to run the process as root or otherwise elevate your privileges to allow the process to listen on the needed ports. **If you are getting an EADDRINUSE error, it means that the port required to run Ogar UL is being used. Usually, Skype is the culprit. To solve this, either close out skype, or change the serverPort value in settings/advconfig.ini to a different port. You will have to change your connection ip to "127.0.0.1:PORT"**


## Configuring Ogar UL
To control how your server is run, Edit files in `src/settings/`


## Custom Game modes
Ogar UL has support for custom game modes. To switch between game modes, change the value of "serverGamemode" in the configurations file to the selected game mode id and restart the server. The current supported game modes are:
